        Hello!!! I'm soooo excited to be starting this journey with you all. My
        name is Daniel. I'm originally from New York. But i've also lived in
        Delaware, Pennsylvania, Florida, Maryland, and now Dallas.

        I've been living in Dallas for almost 2 years now, but it feels like
        only a few months. I say this cause I haven't been anywhere since the
        pandemic. Hopefully things will get better sooner than later.

        I like playing sports, mostly basketball. I started a new hobby of
        cycling during the pandemic. It took me back to when I was a teenager
        and having the thrill of riding my bike everywhere. The longest I've
        gone is 60 miles. The bike community is pretty big here in Dallas.

        I've been on this coding journey for a while now, mainly trying to learn
        on my own with not much luck. This is my first tme learning to code in a
        structured environment. I'm nervous but still excited at the same time.
        Thank you PerScholas for accepting me into this program.
